# required, rather, they customize Gertty to better deal with the
# particulars of Google's Gerrit configuration.

# This file does not list all of the available options.  For a full
# list with explanations, see the 'reference-gertty.yaml' file.

# Commentlinks are regexes that are applied to commit and review
# messages.  They can be replaced with internal or external links, or
# have colors applied.
commentlinks:
  # Match Gerrit change ids, and replace them with a link to an
  # internal Gertty search for that change id.

# This section defines customized dashboards.  You can supply any
# Gertty search string and bind them to any key.  They will appear in
# the global help text, and pressing the key anywhere in Gertty will
# discard the current display stack and replace it with the results of
# the query.

# NB: "recentlyseen:24 hours" does not just return changes seen in the
# last 24 hours -- it returns changes seen within 24 hours of the most
# recently seen change.  So you can take the weekend off and pick up
# where you were.

# Reviewkeys are hotkeys that perform immediate reviews within the
# change screen.  Any pending comments or review messages will be
# attached to the review; otherwise an empty review will be left.  The
# approvals list is exhaustive, so if you specify an empty list,
# Gertty will submit a review that clears any previous approvals.  To
# submit the change with the review, include 'submit: True' with the
# reviewkey.  Reviewkeys appear in the help text for the change
# screen.
