# This is an example ~/.gertty.yaml with an exhaustive listing of
# options with commentary.

# This section lists the servers that Gertty can talk to.  Multiple
# servers may be listed; by default, Gertty will use the first one
# listed.  To select another, simply specify its name on the command
# line.
servers:
  - name: CHANGEME
    url: https://CHANGEME.example.org/
    username: CHANGEME
    # Your HTTP Password for gerrit. Go to the "HTTP Password" section in your
    # account settings to generate/retrieve this password.
    password: CHANGEME
    git-root: ~/git/

# Each server section can have the following fields:
# A name that describes the server, to reference on the command line. [required]
#  - name: sample
# The URL of the Gerrit server.  HTTPS should be preferred. [required]
#    url: https://example.org/
# Your username in Gerrit. [required]
#    username: CHANGEME
# Your password in Gerrit (Settings -> HTTP Password). [required]
#    password: CHANGEME
# Authentication type required by the Gerrit server. Can be 'basic' or
# 'digest'. Defaults to 'digest' if not set or set to an unexpected
# value.
#    auth-type: digest
# A location where Gertty should store its git repositories.  These
# can be the same git repositories where you do your own work --
# Gertty will not modify them unless you tell it to, and even then the
# normal git protections against losing work remain in place. [required]
#    git-root: ~/git/
# The location of Gertty's sqlite database.  If you have more than one
# server, you should specify a dburi for any additional servers.
# By default a SQLite database called ~/.gertty.db is used.
#    dburi: sqlite:////home/user/.gertty.db
# If your Gerrit server uses a non-standard certificate chain (e.g. on a test
# server), you can pass a full path to a bundle of CA certificates here:
#    ssl-ca-path: ~/.pki/ca-chain.pem
# In case you do not care about security and want to use a sledgehammer
# approach to SSL, you can set this value to false to turn off certificate
# validation.
#    verify-ssl: true
# By default Gertty logs errors to a file and truncates that file each
# time it starts (so that it does not grow without bound).  If you
# would like to log to a different location, you may specify it here.
#    log-file: ~/.gertty.log

# Gertty comes with two palettes defined internally.  The default
# palette is suitable for use on a terminal with a dark background.
# The "light" palette is for a terminal with a white or light
# background.  You may customize the colors in either of those
# palettes, or define your own palette.

# The following alters two colors in the default palette, one color in
# the light palette, and one color in a custom palette.  If any color
# is not defined in a palette, the value from the default palette is
# used.  The values are a list of at least two elements describing the
# colors to be use for the foreground and background colors.
# Additional elements can specify (in order) the color to use for
# monochrome terminals, the foreground, and background colors to use
# in high-color terminals.

# For a reference of possible color names, see:
# http://urwid.org/manual/displayattributes.html#foreground-and-background-settings
# To see the list of possible palette entries, run "gertty --print-palette".

palettes:
  - name: default
    added-line: ['dark green', '']
    added-word: ['light green', '']
  - name: light
    filename: ['dark cyan', '']
  - name: custom
    filename: ['light yellow', '']

# Palettes may be selected at runtime with the "-p PALETTE" command
# line option, or you may set the default palette here:
# palette: light

# Keymaps work the same way as palettes.  Only one keymap is defined
# internally, the default keymap.  Individual keys may be overridden
# and custom keymaps defined and selected in the config file or the
# command line.

# Each keymap contains a mapping of command -> key(s).  If a command
# is not specified, Gertty will use the keybinding specified in the
# default map.  More than one key can be bound to a command.

# Run "gertty --print-keymap" for a list of commands that can be
# bound.

keymaps:
  - name: default
    diff: 'd'
  - name: custom
    review: ['r', 'R']

# The default keymap may be selected with the '-k KEYMAP' command line
# option, or with the following line:
# keymap: custom

# Commentlinks are regular expressions that are applied to commit and
# review messages.  They can be replaced with internal or external
# links, or have colors applied.
commentlinks:
# Match Gerrit change ids, and replace them with a link to an internal
# Gertty search for that change id.
  - match: "(?P<id>I[0-9a-fA-F]{40})"
    replacements:
      - search:
          text: "{id}"
          query: "change:{id}"
# Any number of commentlink entries may be specified.  Start each with
# a "match" key and regex.  Named match groups within the regex may be
# used in the replacements section.  Any number of replacements may be
# specified.  The types of replacement available are:
#
# Text: Plain text whose color may be specified.  The color references
# a palette entry.
#      - text:
#          color: ""
#          text: ""
# Link: A hyperlink with the indicated text that when activated will
# open the user's browser with the supplied URL
#      - link:
#          text: ""
#          url: ""
# Search: A hyperlink that will perform a Gertty search when
# activated.
#      - search:
#          text: "{id}"
#          query: "change:{id}"

# This is the query used for the list of changes when a project is
# selected.  The default is "status:open".
# change-list-query: "status:open"

# Uncomment the following line to use a unified diff view instead
# of the default side-by-side:
# diff-view: unified

# Dependent changes are displayed as "threads" in the change list by
# default.  To disable this behavior, uncomment the following line:
# thread-changes: false

# Uncomment the following lines to Hide comments by default that match
# certain criteria.  You can toggle their display with 't'.  Currently
# the only supported criterion is "author".
# hide-comments:
#  - author: "^(.*CI|Jenkins)$"

# This section defines customized dashboards.  You can supply any
# Gertty search string and bind them to any key.  They will appear in
# the global help text, and pressing the key anywhere in Gertty will
# discard the current display stack and replace it with the results of
# the query.
dashboards:
  - name: "My changes"
    query: "owner:self status:open"
    key: "f2"

# Reviewkeys are hotkeys that perform immediate reviews within the
# change screen.  Any pending comments or review messages will be
# attached to the review; otherwise an empty review will be left.  The
# approvals list is exhaustive, so if you specify an empty list,
# Gertty will submit a review that clears any previous approvals.  To
# submit the change with the review, include 'submit: True' with the
# reviewkey.  Reviewkeys appear in the help text for the change
# screen.
reviewkeys:
  - key: 'meta 0'
    approvals: []
  - key: 'meta 1'
    approvals:
      - category: 'Code-Review'
        value: 1
