# Gerrit's Gerrit configuration.  See the reference-gertty.yaml file

# Commentlinks are regexes that are applied to commit and review
# messages.  They can be replaced with internal or external links, or
# have colors applied.
commentlinks:
  # Match Gerrit change ids, and replace them with a link to an
  # internal Gertty search for that change id.

# This section defines customized dashboards.  You can supply any

# Reviewkeys are hotkeys that perform immediate reviews within the
# change screen.  Any pending comments or review messages will be
# attached to the review; otherwise an empty review will be left.  The
# approvals list is exhaustive, so if you specify an empty list,
# Gertty will submit a review that clears any previous approvals.  To
# submit the change with the review, include 'submit: True' with the
# reviewkey.  Reviewkeys appear in the help text for the change
# screen.
